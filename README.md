# NASA SUITS 2024 HMD App :eyeglasses:

Team Cartographer's HMD (Head Mounted Device) code for the NASA SUITS (Spacesuit User Interface Technologies for Students) Challenge 2023/24. <br>

This project relies on [Microsoft's Mixed Reality ToolKit](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/mrtk-unity/mrtk3-overview/), as well as [Meta's Quest Unity Toolings](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/unity-gs-overview/) for build support.

Contents:

- [Running the App](#computer-running-the-app)

Software Dependencies:

- `Unity 2022.3.16f1`
- `Windows 10+` (for Building MRTK Components)
- `git 2.43.0`

Scripts can be found in [Unity HMD/Assets](Unity%20HMD/Assets)

## :rocket: About the App

- You can try the LMCC App on either a Meta Quest 2+ or a Microsoft HoloLens2 by building it directly to the device through Unity.
- This application also relies on a concurrently running [Team Cartographer LMCC Console](https://github.com/Team-Cartographer/SUITS-2024-LMCC), whose setup instructions are present in its own README.
  - That server also relies on the presence of the NASA-provided [SUITS 2024 TSS Server](https://github.com/SUITS-Techteam/TSS_2024), which needs to be set up to run everything smoothly.
- **Please note that the LMCC Console, TSS Server, and VR Device all need to be on the same WiFi/Local Network to connect and transmit data properly!**

## :computer: Running the App

In terms of running the App, you can run it directly in Unity's editor environment on any device, but to build to a VR Device (Such as [Microsoft HoloLens2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens/hardware#document-experiences) or [Meta Quest 2+](https://www.meta.com/quest/)), you _must_ be on a device running Windows 10 or greater, as Visual Studio support _is required_

Full Build Information is coming soon...
